## Neural Networks
- Deep learning has its origins in early work that tried to model networks of neurons in the brain with computational circuits
	- For this reason, the networks trained by deep learning methods are often called neural networks, even though the resemblance to real neural cells and structure is superficial
## [[Feedforward Networks]]
