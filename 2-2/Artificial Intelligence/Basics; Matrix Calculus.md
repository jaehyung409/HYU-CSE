#### The Gradient
> The matrix of partial derivatives
- $\triangledown_x{b^Tx}=b$
- $\triangledown_x{x^TAx}=2Ax$
#### The Hessian
> The matrix of second-order partial derivatives (symmetric)
#### Least Squares
> vector x such that Ax is as close as possible to b, as measured by the square of the Euclidean norm
