## Deep Learning
> Deep learning is a broad family of techniques for machine learning in which hypotheses take the form of complex algebraic circuits with tunable connection strengths.
> - The word "deep" refers to the fact that the circuits are typically organized into many layers, which means that computation paths from inputs to outputs have many steps.
### Why is Deep Learning Successful?

	- While the true reasons for the success of deep learning have yet to be fully elucidated, it has self-evident advantages over other methods
		- linear/logistic regression can handle many input variables, the computation path from each input to the output is very short.
		- Deceision trees allow for long computation paths that can depend on many input variables, but only for a relatively small fraction of the possible input vectors. (if it has long computation paths -> it must be exponentially large in the \# of input variables)
	- The basic idea of deep learning is to train circuits such that the computation paths are long
		- Allowing all the input variables to interact in complex ways
