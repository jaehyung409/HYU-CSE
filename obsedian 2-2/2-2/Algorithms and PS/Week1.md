## Orientation

Performanc of Algorithms 
- Running time (Time Complexity) - mainly important
- Space Consumption (Space Complexity) - sometimes important

Class Outline
- Problem 
	- Why the problem
	- problem definition
- Algorithm
	- Description
	- Correctness
	- Performance (time , space)

## Getting Started
- ### Problems![[Sorting Alogrithms#Sorting Problems]]

- ### Sorting Algorithms
1. [[Insertion Sort]]![[Insertion Sort#Code]]
2. [[Merge Sort]]![[Merge Sort#Code]]

- ### Performance analyze
	1. Aritmetic
		- Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, remainder, floor, ceiling
	2. Data movement
		- Load, store, copy
	3. Control
		- Conditional  branch
		- Unconditional branch
		- Subroutine call and return
	- Running time, function with Input size
		-  T(n) : The sum of product of cost and times of each line
		- Best Case : $\Omega(n)$
		- Average Case : $\Theta(n)$
		- Worst Case : $O(n)$
	- log scale => $lgn = log_2n$
