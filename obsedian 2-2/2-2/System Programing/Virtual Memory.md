### Virtual Memory
- Using main memory efficiently
	- Use DRAM as a cache for portions of a virtual address space
- Simplifying memory management
	- Each process gets the same uniform linear address space
- Isolating address spaces
	- One process can't interfere with another's memory
	- User program can't access privileged kernel information and code
