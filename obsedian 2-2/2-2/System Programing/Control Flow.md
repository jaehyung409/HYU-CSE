## Control Flow
- Processors do only one thing :
	- From startup to shutdown, a CPU simply reads and executes(interprets) a sequence of instructions, one at a time
	- This sequence is the CPU's control flow (or flow of control)

- Altering the Control Flow
	- Up to now : two mechanisms for changing control flow (React to changes in <font color="#e36c09">program state</font>)
		- Jumps and Branches
		- Call and Return
	- Insufficient for a useful system : Difficult to react to changes in ***system state***
		- Data arrives from a disk or a network adapter
		- Instruction divides by zero
		- User hits Ctrl-C at the keyboard
		- System timer expires
	- System need mechanisms for "[[Exceptional Control Flow]]"
