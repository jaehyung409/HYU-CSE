## Dynamic Memory Allocation
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/CCUxqpq.png)
- Programmers use <font color="#fac08f">dynamic memory allocators</font> (such as $\text{malloc}$) to acquire VM at run time
	- For data structures whose size is only known at runtime
- Dynamic memory allocators manage an area of process virtual memory known as the <font color="#fac08f">heap</font>
- Allocator maintains heap as collection of variable <font color="#fac08f">sized blocks</font>, which are either <font color="#fac08f">allocated</font> or <font color="#fac08f">free</font>
- Types of allocators
	- Explicit allocator : application allocates and frees space
		- E.g., [[The malloc Package]] in C
	- Implicit allocator
		- E.g., garbage collection in JAVA, ML, and Lisp
