### AI 
- Applications in many fields
- Weak AI vs Strong AI ( 3 types of AI)
	1. ANI : Narrow AI, Week AI, It is goal-oriented to perform different task
	2. AGI : Deep AI, Strong AI, In any given situation, think, understand, and behave in a manner that can be no different from that of a human being
	3. ASI : The conceptual AI that does not merely mimic or recognize human intelligence and behaviour; computers that are self-conscious and outperform human ability and knowledge
- Turing Test : can't reliably tell the machine from the human
- Machine Learning ( Learning from data )
- Deep Learning (based on aritificial neural networks, deeply)
