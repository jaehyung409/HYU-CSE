## Resolution Algorithm
> Inference procedures based on resolution work by using the principle of proof by <font color="#fac08f">contradiction</font>.
> - To show that $KB$ ⊨ $\alpha$, we show that (KB ∧ ¬$\alpha$) is unsatisfiable.
- Algorithm
	- First, ($KB$ ∧ ¬$\alpha$) is converted into CNF.
	- Then, the resolution rule is applied to the resulting clauses.
		- The clauses generated by resolution are added to the $KB$ if they do not exist in the $KB$.
	- The process continues until one of two things happens:
		- There are no new clauses that can be added, in which case <font color="#fac08f">$KB$ does not entail</font>.
		- Two clauses resolve to yield the empty clause, in which case <font color="#fac08f">$KB$ entails</font>.
			- The empty clause is equivalent to <font color="#fac08f">False</font> because a disjunction is true only if at least one of its disjunts is true.
			- The empty clause arises only from resolving two contradictory unit clauses such as $P$ and ¬$P$.

## Code
```pseudo code
function PL-RESOLUTION(KB,α) returns true or false
	inputs: KB,the knowledge base,a sentence in propositional logic
			α,the query,a sentence in propositional logic
	clauses <- the set of clauses in the CNF representation of KB∧¬α
	new <- {}
	while true do
		for each pair of clauses C[i],C[j] in clauses do
			resolvents <- PL-RESOLVE(C[i],C[j])
			if resolvents contains the empty clause then return true
			new <- new∪resolvents
		if new⊆clauses then return false
		clauses<-clauese∪new
